# 💰 Trading System

ROUGEE.PLAY's revolutionary trading system allows fans to buy and sell shares of their favorite songs, creating a new way to support artists and potentially profit from their success.

## 🎯 How Trading Works

### The Concept
Instead of just streaming music, fans can now **own shares** of songs they love. These shares can be bought and sold, creating a liquid market for music ownership.

### Key Benefits
- **Support Artists**: Your investment directly supports the artist
- **Potential Profit**: Share prices can increase as songs gain popularity
- **Liquid Market**: Buy and sell shares anytime
- **Transparent**: All trades are recorded on the blockchain

## 🔄 Trading Mechanics

### Bonding Curves
ROUGEE.PLAY uses **bonding curves** for fair price discovery:

```
Price = Initial Price + (Tokens Sold × Price Increment)
```

#### Example:
- **Initial Price**: 0.01 XRGE per token
- **Price Increment**: 0.001 XRGE per token sold
- **Tokens Sold**: 100 tokens
- **Current Price**: 0.01 + (100 × 0.001) = 0.11 XRGE per token

### Price Discovery
- **Algorithmic**: Prices determined by supply and demand
- **Fair**: No manipulation possible
- **Transparent**: All calculations on-chain
- **Predictable**: Price changes are mathematically determined
